Pets From The Inventory or Pfti for short is a nice little mod that adds small pets which can have nice little things.
Discover them all to see what the mod offers and try to have fun!

## What does it offer?

It adds different kinds of mob based pets, workbench pets and other random things. If you have suggestions please make them! As I would love to add more pets and make this mod more alive than ever!

I will work on add mod compatibility later with some cute and useful mobs/workbenches if people desire so!

## Is this a fork of Inventory Pets?

Short answer? No

Long answer? Inventory Pets is first of closed source, so I couldn't look how the code structure looks like. 
Secondly, everything here is coded by me. All the art is done by me and most importantly. Pets From The Inventory has taken some inspiration from Inventory Pets but adds on top of what's already there. 
It will have different mechanics, it will work differently than Inventory Pets, and it shouldn't be confused with Inventory Pets. These are their own separate mods and don't think this is a fork of any kind.

## Will this come for X modloader?

It will eventually if the mod gets some traction. Currently, it's developed in Fabric as I've the most experience with this modloader, and it also has Quilt support somewhat due to how Quilt is currently built. But if the mod gets traction I will most likely make this a [multiloader](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template) project.
